- Ability to book appointments for review.
- If a patient has an appointment booked, a reminder email must be sent prior to the examination date.
- Option to leave a review for an examination already attended
- If the role is that of an administrator, set in the database creation, then there will be the ability to create and cancel bookings (sessions) as well as access previous ones.
- Administrators only have the authorization to create a doctoral profile.
- Doctors have the ability to cancel (refuse) examinations as well as access previous ones.
- Patients as well as Doctors have the ability to edit their profile, change their password, and remove their profiles.

II. Backend (Logical part) - PHP
III. Database - MySQL

Task analysis, main goals and ideas
The aim of the project is to facilitate the patients who wish to visit the particular medical facility, and to provide the doctors with the opportunity to digitize their schedule for a more efficient workflow.
This is made possible through the creation of a web-based application that provides this capability. Apart from the usual recording of review times, the project also aims to be interactive, engaging,
providing users with a sense of orientation, convenience, creating an intuitive design. To this end, research was done on what users are looking for in a web page. It was found that many of today's users expect
to find what they are looking for quickly and easily. Responsive design is a modern approach to achieving this goal. It also matters a lot how intuitive a page is, because this is the deciding factor whether
the user or visitor will stay on the web application or leave after having a quick look at the content. A recent study by a global consultancy firm reveals that the average user approaches web applications
with scepticism and at the same time with mild curiosity. This suggests that if you give visitors what they are looking for quickly, there is a greater chance that their interest in the web application will
increase. We also take into account that people of all age groups would use the site, so it is made as convenient and easy to navigate as possible. The idea is that the design of the web-based application
should meet the needs of our users as much as possible. 

This is also our goal. By finding out what users were looking for, I did my best to make the site meet their needs. The web app offers the ability to search for doctors desired by the user, making it even
easier and faster to book the desired appointment. There is also a section on the main page to display a given patient's upcoming bookings, making it possible to quickly and seamlessly access all available 
bookings. In addition, there is an option to select a button in the navigation box that automatically sends the user to the section with their saved upcoming bookings as well as previous ones that they
can leave a review on. All of this is done for user convenience, quick orientation and easy discovery of the desired review.
Our web-based app differs from others in that we will offer a different approach to booking reviews for doctors who only use our platform. Regarding the app, it differs from many others
by its simple but well meaning design as well as the lack of multiple advertisements that would hinder users. The progress and process of building our app has been accompanied and coordinated
with medical professionals for their utmost convenience. Also, unlike all other apps, it is not created with a ready-made design template, but everything is original and unique.
